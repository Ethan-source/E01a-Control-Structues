This is an assignment for "Game Techonology" 13370 at indiana university. 
So there were 10 main pages of python code. This exercise was meant to challange our intuition and problem solving skills to figure out what the code essentially did. As the pages continued, they got gradually more complicated and could perform more tasks. There was a page of questions that guided us from main1.py to main10.py and we answered the question on that page as we completed the assignment.
